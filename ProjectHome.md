These are builds of the Commotion Wireless system for a Raspberry Pi. They will require a number of dependencies to work. Original project is here: http://commotionwireless.net. All I have done is download source from github using this script:

https://github.com/natmey/commotion-deb-builder

You will need to manually compile and install commotiond for these to work ( I needed to to compile everything, don't know if it's NEEDED to run... )
